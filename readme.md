# Understanding BEM Naming for CSS Classes

The [BEM website](https://getbem.com/naming/) contains more information.

These are guidelines for creating CSS class names.

1. Multi-word names use hyphens instead of spaces.

- Eg: user-form

2. Double underscore between organizational parts

- Eg: form, form\_\_input, block, block\_\_elem, nav, nav_link, card\_\_heading

3. Double hyphen for modifiers

- Eg: nav--main, form--simple, button--disabled
